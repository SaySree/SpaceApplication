##########################Space Launch App####################
Done:

1.	The initial launch programs landing page ideally should be server-side-rendered.
2.	A boilerplate to implement the Server-side rendering can be used.
3.	User should be able to Filter the results with help of provided Filters.
	Filter options are hard coded with the values shown in the visual comp below.
	Applying any Filter should reflect the below changes:
•	Selected filter should change to selected state as shown in the visual comp.
•	Applied filters should change the URL and update the Page with latest records without refreshing the page.

1.	Page should visually match with the provided designs at the end of this file.
2.	Responsive Behavior:
	Implementation should follow Mobile first design approach
	Mobile View: Page should have only one Column until 700 px. We have provided the Visual designs for Mobile screen.(Responsiveness will be around 414-800 px)
	Tablet View: Page should have 2 columns between 700 and 1024 px. Design is provided for Desktop tile and that should be followed for this viewport.(800-1000px)
	Desktop View: Page should have 4 columns between 1024 and 1440 px. Beyond 1440px viewport,  the content will be centered align with a max width of 1440.(1024-1440px)

The ask:
1.	Develop a responsive layout matching the visual comps provided. The tablet version to have a 2-column product tile layout.
2.	Incorporate all performance best practices and demonstrate a high Lighthouse score for Performance, SEO and Accessibility.
